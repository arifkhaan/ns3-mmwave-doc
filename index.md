This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") module for the simulation
of 5G mmWave cellular networks. A description of ns3-mmwave can be found on [IEEExplore (open access)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116/ "mmwave paper").

This module builds on top of the LTE one, and currently includes features such as:

* Support of a wide range of channel models, including the model based on 3GPP TR 38.901 for frequencies between 0.5 and 100 GHz. Ray tracing and measured traces can also be used.

* Custom PHY and MAC classes supporting the 3GPP NR frame structure and numerologies. They support dynamic TDD, and are parameterized and highly customizable in order to be flexible enough for testing different designs.

* Custom schedulers for the dynamic TDD format

* Carrier Aggregation at the MAC layer

* Enhancements to the RLC layer with re-segmentation of packets for retransmissions

* Dual Connectivity with LTE base stations, with fast secondary cell handover and channel tracking

* Simulation of core network elements (with also the MME as a real node)

The following papers describe in detail the features implemented in the mmWave
module:
- [End-to-End Simulation of 5G mmWave Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116/ "comst paper") is a comprehensive tutorial with a detailed description of the whole module. We advise the researchers interested in this module to start reading from this paper;
- [Integration of Carrier Aggregation and Dual Connectivity for the ns-3 mmWave Module](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06706 "wns3 2018") describes the Carrier Aggregation implementation;
- [Implementation of A Spatial Channel Model for ns-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09341 "wns3 2020") describes the integration of the spatial channel model based on the 3GPP specifications TR 38.901 V15.0.0;
- [Performance Comparison of Dual Connectivity and Hard Handover for LTE-5G Tight Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05425 "simutools paper") describes the Dual Connectivity feature.

These other papers describe features that were implemented in older releases: 
- [ns-3 Implementation of the 3GPP MIMO Channel Model for Frequency Spectrum above 6 GHz](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3067678 "wns3 2017") describes the implementation of the 3GPP channel model based on TR 38.900;
- [Multi-Sector and Multi-Panel Performance in 5G mmWave Cellular Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04905 "globecom2018") describes the multi-sector addition to the 3GPP channel model;

## Future work
We are actively developing new features for the mmWave module, including:
- 3GPP NR beam tracking
- 3GPP NR Integrated Access and Backhaul feature (see [this repo](https://github.com/signetlabdei/ns3-mmwave-iab) for more details)
